title: Honest Reactions for Linux on Mi Pad 5 Project
---
Power, Multi-tasking, and low price are the key of a tablet. </br>
But now, time changed. :( </br>
And so do I. </br>
 </br>
 </br>
 </br>
This 
## is the biggest mistake any company made ever !!
...What?</br>
Shut the *beep* up! We understand the software is important for our tablet, but why you guys are increasing the difficulty </br>
of unlocking bootloader?
## For security.
The only reason we like Xiaomi, is the easily unlocking bootloader and a hackable mobile device.</br>
And why you force us to upgrade to level 5 in your freaking Xiaomi community, and pass your extremely difficult unlocking exam,</br>
then wait for 3 days to unlock the bootloader?
## It's cool.
You know what? Even an experienced Android developer can also fail the test!</br>
Unlocking bootloader, aren't supposed to have any requirements!
## It doesn't.
Well then, I don't want to continue maintaining mainline kernel, and Armbian port for your Mi Pad 5. It looks like an iPad clone</br>
shipped with your buggy modified Android ! </br>
And why I have to fix the In8000 charger in mainline kernel?
## Well, it's acturally a PUN.
What?</br>
Well, basically, you have a tablet powered by a Li-Lon Battery, and we often call them "E-tablet". As for nabu, it's an E-tablet, it's a *char-Ger* ! Get it?</br>
... I'm tired of seeing it !</br>
## What do you want us to make?
A high-performence, ARM-based, hackable Linux tablet !
## ... People want that?
YES !
## OK. Chill, just let me finish this post.
Alrignt, I'm too tired to deal with *beep* compiling errors.
## Anyways, we saved your tablet !
... Just we can kill it later.</br>

*beep*
